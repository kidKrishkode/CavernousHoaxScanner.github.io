### A Project by WHITE LOTUS 🌸

## Introduction
Welcome to **Cavernous Hoax Scanner**, a cutting-edge tool designed to detect and analyze deepfake images. Deepfakes are synthetic media where a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness. With the increasing sophistication of deepfake technology, it's crucial to have reliable methods to identify and mitigate potential misuse.

## Aim 🎯
Our aim is to provide a robust system that:
1. **Detects** whether an image is a deepfake.
2. **Classifies** the level of harm or vulnerability associated with the detected deepfake.
3. **Provides explanations** for why a deepfake is deemed harmful or vulnerable.

## How It Works 🛠️
1. **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image through our intuitive React-based interface.
2. **Processing**: The image is sent to our Node.js backend, where it is then processed using advanced Python-based machine learning models.
3. **Detection**: The system analyzes the image to determine if it's a deepfake.
4. **Classification**: If a deepfake is detected, the system further classifies its potential harm and provides detailed reasons for its assessment.
5. **Output**: Results are displayed back on the user interface, along with any pertinent information about the deepfake's vulnerability.

## Technologies Used 🖥️
- **Frontend**: React.js for a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js for efficient handling of API requests and server-side logic.
- **Machine Learning**: Python for deep learning models that detect and classify deepfakes.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data and analysis results.
- **APIs**: Our system includes APIs for integration with other systems and platforms.

## Programming Languages 💻
- **JavaScript** (React, Node.js)
- **Python** (Machine Learning Models)
- **HTML/CSS** (UI/UX Design)
